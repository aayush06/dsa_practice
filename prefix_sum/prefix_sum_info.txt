- compute the cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers
- resulting array is the sum of all elements of the original array up to that index
- used in range sum queries.

Steps -
    Initialize an array of the same size as the input array.
    The first element of the prefix sum array is the same as the first element of the input array.
    For each subsequent element, add the current element of the input array to the previous element of the prefix sum array.
        prefix[i]=prefix[iâˆ’1]+arr[i]
